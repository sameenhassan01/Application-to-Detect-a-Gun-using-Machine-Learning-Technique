# Application-to-Detect-a-Gun-using-Machine-Learning-Technique
A system is proposed which will identify gun from an image using an advance technique of Computer vision and Machine learning. Our model is fully trained with a data set using a Machine learning technique which will make the model smart enough to identify gun from a static image. The technique used in this project is YOLO, it’s a convolutional neural network for doing object detection in real-time. The algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image, and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region.
#	Objectives
Our main objective is to collect relevant dataset to train our application which is to detect a gun from a static image and then to accurately annotate that dataset so that it can be classified /trained using machine learning technique (Yolo). So that our application can detect a gun from a static image using that trained model.

# Business Scope
The main idea behind this project is to avoid crimes. If the model successfully identifies gun in a static image, it can be used in a dynamic system in future where the system would convert frames of a video in pictures and would pass it to the model, if the model identifies gun, the police will be alerted. A plethora crimes can be prevented this way and it will create a safer environment. 

# Useful Tools and Technologies
We will use python in our project, Google colab it’s a free cloud service and now it supports free GPU. Also use the tool Labelling for annotating the static image.
